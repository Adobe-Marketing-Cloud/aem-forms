 * Addition of guideWidget class on the dropdown div, sets the height to 38px in Adaptive Form. This happens because of
 * the default Adaptive Form Theme. This leads to some gap between the svg element and the select list that becomes
 * visible on click of the svg element.
 * So for now, I have made the height to inherit the parent.
 * The recommended way is to create a new custom theme for Guide and setting the less variable
 * @widget-height to inherit or some default value that suits you.
